## AGILE SCRUM WORKFLOW de desarrollo INNOCEAN MÉXICO

Scrum is one of the agile methodologies designed to guide teams in the iterative and incremental delivery of a product. Often referred to as “an agile project management framework,” its focus is on the use of an empirical process that allows teams to respond rapidly, efficiently, and effectively to change. 

´´´Scrum on the other hand, fixes time and cost in an effort to control requirements.

The involvement of the business throughout the project is critical as Scrum relies heavily on the collaboration between the team and the customer or customer representative to create the right product in a lean fashion.

´´´Scrum is simply one of many agile approaches to product development.

1. The project begins with a clear vision provided by the business (BRIEFING), and a set of product features in order of importance
  - These features are part of the product backlog, which is maintained by the customer or customer representative referred to as the Product Owner.

2. Time box commonly referred to as an iteration or sprint, is the set amount of time that the team has to complete the features selected.
  - The team selects items from the product backlog that it believes can be completed in the sprint, and creates a sprint backlog consisting of the features and tasks as part of the sprint-planning meeting.

3. Once the team has committed to a sprint backlog, the task work begins.
  - During this time in the sprint, the team is protected from interruptions and allowed to focus on meeting the sprint goal.
  - No changes to the sprint backlog are allowed; however, the product backlog can be changed in preparation for the next sprint.

4. During the sprint, the team checks in daily with each other in the form of a 15-minute meeting known as a scrum.

5. At the end of the sprint, the team demos the work they have completed to the stakeholders and gathers feedback that will affect what they work on in the next sprint.
  - This meeting is critical, as its focus is on the three pillars of Scrum: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.
