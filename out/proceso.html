This is often done quarterly, and the results of the quarter do not have to be a release to the customer, but may simply be an internal release to confirm system integration and validation.</p><p>The entire team attends the release-planning meeting, where the Product Owner presents the features she/he would like to see completed in the quarter.</p><div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/innoceanmexico/workflow/raw/master/public/release.jpg" alt="innocean méxico" title="innocean méxico"/></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/proceso","query":{},"buildId":"DgUtATkDjDRoETptG1wyb","assetPrefix":"/workflow","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false}</script><script nomodule="" src="/workflow/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-28a453ab78bd7ac4fdb9.js"></script><script src="/workflow/_next/static/chunks/main-ae4733327bd95c4ac325.js" async=""></script><script src="/workflow/_next/static/chunks/webpack-50bee04d1dc61f8adf5b.js" async=""></script><script src="/workflow/_next/static/chunks/framework.a81ea598d7fae17b1ab2.js" async=""></script><script src="/workflow/_next/static/chunks/commons.9528123feb626448eb3f.js" async=""></script><script src="/workflow/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-242b1fccee1ad4cb9fa8.js" async=""></script><script src="/workflow/_next/static/chunks/ad678dd76c9843c4a47c17059cfd68f55ff04f66.112239674b105205d408.js" async=""></script><script src="/workflow/_next/static/chunks/pages/proceso-04be34a4880b0b223bd9.js" async=""></script><script src="/workflow/_next/static/DgUtATkDjDRoETptG1wyb/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/workflow/_next/static/DgUtATkDjDRoETptG1wyb/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
